A Hypothetical Convergence: Applying Fractal Intelligence Frameworks to Cortical Labs' Synthetic Biological Intelligence
Part I: The Substrate - Cortical Labs CL1 and Synthetic Biological Intelligence
The emergence of commercially viable biological computing platforms marks a significant inflection point in the history of artificial intelligence. Moving beyond software simulations that are merely inspired by the brain, these systems utilize living neural tissue as a core computational substrate. At the vanguard of this paradigm shift is Cortical Labs and its CL1 system, a technology that compels a re-evaluation of how intelligence can be engineered, trained, and deployed. Understanding its architecture, learning mechanisms, and the ethical landscape it inhabits is essential before exploring its potential synthesis with other advanced theoretical frameworks.
Section 1.1: The CL1 System: Architecture and Operation
The Cortical Labs CL1 system is the world's first commercially available, code-deployable biological computer. It materializes the concept of Synthetic Biological Intelligence (SBI), a form of computing that fundamentally collapses the distinction between a simulated neural network and a biological one. Instead of running software that mimics neurons, the CL1 is a neural network, integrating living biological components with a silicon-based interface.
The physical architecture is ingeniously self-contained. Housed in a shoebox-sized unit, the CL1 functions as a "body in a box," integrating all necessary components for operation without requiring an external computer for its core processing. The heart of this system is its "wetware": a culture of approximately 800,000 live human neurons grown on a high-density microelectrode array (MEA). These neurons are derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which are ethically sourced and capable of differentiating into various cell types, in this case, cortical neurons. This neural culture is sustained by a sophisticated, closed-loop life-support system that circulates a nutrient-rich broth, manages temperature and gas mixtures, and filters waste products. This robust environment allows the neuronal culture to remain viable and functional for six months or longer, a critical timeframe for long-term research and learning experiments.
The bridge between the biological and digital realms is the MEA. The CL1 employs a planar array of 59 electrodes on a stable metal and glass substrate, an evolution from the less stable CMOS-based arrays used in the company's earlier "DishBrain" prototype. This MEA provides a bi-directional interface, capable of delivering precise electrical stimuli to the neurons and, conversely, reading the electrical activity that constitutes their collective response.
Facilitating this interaction is Cortical Labs' proprietary Biological Intelligence Operating System, or biOS. This software layer creates a simulated world for the neurons, translating digital code into patterns of electrical impulses—the "shared language" of silicon and biology—and interpreting the neurons' reactions in real-time. This establishes a high-performance, closed-loop feedback system where the neurons' activity directly influences their simulated environment, and vice versa. To ensure broad accessibility, the system is programmable via a standard Python API and can be connected to external hardware like cameras and actuators, enabling a wide range of custom experiments.
Recognizing the barrier that specialized wet lab facilities can present, Cortical Labs has also launched the Cortical Cloud, a "Wetware-as-a-Service" (WaaS) platform. This service allows researchers to remotely access and deploy code to CL1 units housed in server stacks, streaming data and receiving results through familiar tools like Jupyter notebooks. This model democratizes access to SBI, enabling a global community of researchers to build upon the technology. The CL1 system was officially launched in March 2025 and is commercially available for approximately $35,000 per unit, with wider distribution planned for later in the year.
Section 1.2: The Learning Paradigm: The Free Energy Principle in Practice
The CL1's most revolutionary aspect may not be its hardware but its method of learning, which is a direct, practical application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), a comprehensive theory of brain function developed by Professor Karl Friston. The FEP posits that any self-organizing system that resists a natural tendency to disorder—from a single cell to a human brain—must act in ways that minimize its "variational free energy". This quantity can be understood as a proxy for "surprise" or "prediction error": the mismatch between the system's internal, predictive model of the world and the actual sensory information it receives. A system can minimize this surprise in two ways: by updating its internal model to better match reality (perception and learning) or by acting on the world to make reality better match its predictions (action). This process of acting to fulfill predictions is known as Active Inference.
Cortical Labs' seminal "DishBrain" experiment, which successfully taught a neuronal culture to play the video game Pong, was designed as an explicit test of the FEP. The learning was not driven by a conventional reward signal but by carefully structured electrophysiological feedback. When the neurons' spontaneous activity resulted in the virtual paddle hitting the ball, the biOS delivered a predictable, structured electrical signal to the culture. When the paddle missed, the culture received an unpredictable, chaotic, or "noisy" signal. In accordance with the FEP, the neuronal network spontaneously self-organized its activity to avoid the surprising (noisy) state and preferentially enter the predictable one. In doing so, it learned to play the game in a goal-directed manner, without any explicit programming of game rules or objectives.
This learning paradigm yields remarkable performance characteristics. The neurons demonstrated significant improvement in gameplay within just five minutes of real-time interaction. Comparative studies have shown that this rate of learning is orders of magnitude more sample-efficient than state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms when matched for time and data exposure. This underscores the profound ability of biological intelligence to generalize and learn from sparse data, a persistent challenge for silicon-based AI.
This efficiency extends to energy consumption. The learning mechanism is not just an abstract principle; it is deeply intertwined with the underlying thermodynamics of the system. Traditional DRL is energetically costly, requiring massive computational resources for brute-force state exploration and backpropagation. The FEP, however, provides the biological system with a powerful, intrinsic heuristic. The innate drive to minimize surprise efficiently prunes the vast search space of possible actions, as the system is not exploring randomly but is actively seeking states of low informational entropy. This synergy between the biological substrate and the learning principle results in extreme energy efficiency. While individual neurons operate in the milliwatt range, an entire server rack of CL1 units consumes less than 1 kilowatt of power—a mere fraction of the energy demanded by GPU clusters performing comparable learning tasks. This suggests that the path to truly sustainable AI may depend not just on more efficient silicon, but on harnessing fundamental principles of self-organization.
Section 1.3: Context and Ethics: SBI, Organoid Intelligence, and the Sentience Debate
The CL1 system exists at the intersection of several rapidly advancing and overlapping fields. Cortical Labs describes its technology as Synthetic Biological Intelligence (SBI), defined by the integration of living neurons—in this case, a 2D monolayer culture—into a digital, closed-loop computational system. This work is a foundational precursor to the broader and more ambitious field of Organoid Intelligence (OI). OI aims to utilize 3D human brain organoids as a substrate for biocomputing. Proponents of OI argue that 3D organoids, which self-assemble into more complex structures with distinct cell layers and greater diversity, more faithfully replicate the in vivo architecture of the brain and thus hold greater potential for advanced, brain-like computation. The CL1 can therefore be understood as a pioneering, first-generation SBI platform that has proven the core principles of "brain-directed computing," while OI represents a potential next-generation evolution toward more complex biological hardware.
A central research ambition for Cortical Labs is to use the CL1 as a tool to investigate the concept of a "Minimal Viable Brain" (MVB)—the simplest possible configuration of neural cells capable of exhibiting complex, intelligent information processing. By systematically adding different cell types to the culture and observing the emergent functional properties, the CL1 provides an unprecedented platform for answering this fundamental question in neuroscience.
This pioneering work inevitably pushes into a sensitive ethical frontier. The development of both SBI and OI has ignited a robust debate concerning the potential for these systems to develop properties like sentience, consciousness, or moral status. This raises profound questions: Could a sufficiently complex system experience suffering? What are the rights and privacy concerns of the original cell donor? What is the legal and moral status of a biological computer?.
The commercial reality of the CL1 transforms these questions from abstract, future-tense speculations into immediate, practical concerns. While the OI debate often focuses on future, highly complex 3D organoids, the CL1 is a product available today, with a price tag and a cloud service for "renting human brain cells". This commercialization forces urgent consideration of applied ethics and corporate responsibility, setting precedents for the entire field. How is donor consent managed for a commercial product that will be used by third parties? Who is liable for the actions of a CL1-powered system?.
In response, a consensus is forming around the need for proactive, "embedded ethics" frameworks. This approach advocates for continuous, interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists, ethicists, policymakers, and the public to identify and address ethical dilemmas as the technology evolves, rather than reacting after unforeseen consequences arise. However, a counter-perspective also exists, cautioning against "neurorealist" biases and premature hype that could lead to overly burdensome regulations based on speculative fears, potentially stifling legitimate and beneficial research into neurological diseases. These researchers argue for a sober, evidence-driven approach that clearly communicates the current limitations of the technology to maintain public trust. The CL1, as the first commercial entity in this space, serves as a crucial test case for navigating this complex ethical landscape.
To clarify the distinctions between these computing paradigms, the following table provides a comparative analysis.

Part II: The Theoretical Frameworks - Fractal Approaches to Intelligence
The term "fractal" evokes images of self-similarity and complexity arising from simple rules, concepts that have long inspired AI researchers. However, the query juxtaposes two distinct theories that employ this term in fundamentally different ways. One describes a dynamic process of decision-making, while the other describes a static network architecture. Understanding this philosophical and practical divergence is critical to any hypothetical synthesis with a biological substrate like the CL1.
Section 2.1: Fractal AI: A Fragile Theory of Intelligence
"Fractal AI: A Fragile Theory of Intelligence," developed by Sergio Hernandez Cerezo and Guillem Duran Ballester, is not a neural network architecture but a comprehensive theoretical framework for general artificial intelligence. Its foundations lie in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and information theory, proposing a novel method for decision-making and planning.
The theory's first principle is its method of modeling information. Instead of relying on the smooth, continuous functions that underpin most of machine learning, Fractal AI models state spaces and information flow using discrete, cellular automaton-like structures. A cellular automaton (CA) is a computational model consisting of a grid of cells, each with a finite state. The system evolves in discrete time steps, with the state of each cell in the next generation determined by a simple, fixed rule based on the states of its neighbors. This local simplicity can give rise to extraordinarily complex and emergent global patterns. By adopting this model, Fractal AI aims to build a new form of stochastic calculus better suited for complex, dynamic systems.
A second core tenet is its focus on "forward-thinking" intelligence. The authors draw a sharp distinction between this and the "backward-thinking" approach of most contemporary AI. Instead of learning from vast datasets of past experiences, a Fractal AI agent makes decisions by performing a near-perfect simulation of the system's future evolution, allowing it to ponder the foreseeable consequences of its available actions.
The name of the theory itself—"A fragile theory of intelligence"—is deeply meaningful. This "fragility" does not imply weakness. Rather, it alludes to the nature of the systems the theory seeks to model: complex, non-equilibrium systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions and operate at the "edge of chaos". Much of modern AI engineering strives for "robustness"—insensitivity to noise and perturbation. Fractal AI, in contrast, appears to embrace the idea that intelligence emerges from the delicate, dynamic balance of these inherently unstable systems. It suggests that true general intelligence may not be a product of building an indestructible computational fortress, but rather a sensitive, responsive "seismograph" that can harness the complex dynamics of its environment.
From these principles, practical algorithms have been derived. Fractal Monte Carlo (FMC) is a planning algorithm that has demonstrated remarkable efficiency, reportedly solving Atari games using fewer than 1,000 samples to calculate each action, compared to the 3 million samples required by standard Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This is achieved by efficiently scanning the space of future states and generating a database of high-performing examples with minimal computation, effectively transforming a reinforcement learning problem into a more tractable supervised learning problem.
Section 2.2: FractalNet: Self-Similar Architectures for Deep Learning
In stark contrast to the process-oriented theory of Fractal AI, FractalNet is a specific, static deep neural network architecture developed by Gustav Larsson, Michael Maire, and Gregory Shakhnarovich. It was introduced as a direct and competitive alternative to Residual Networks (ResNets) for the purpose of building and training ultra-deep convolutional neural networks.
The architecture is defined by its recursive fractal expansion. A simple building block, such as a convolutional layer, is recursively expanded according to a fixed rule, generating a network with a precise, self-similar structure. This results in a network containing many interacting parallel subpaths of varying lengths. For instance, a fractal block with C columns will have a longest path of depth $2^{C-1}$.
The most radical design choice in FractalNet is its complete eschewal of residual connections. At the time of its creation, ResNets had become the dominant paradigm for training very deep networks, based on the idea that "skip" or "pass-through" connections were essential to combat the vanishing gradient problem. FractalNet demonstrated that this was not fundamental. In a FractalNet, every internal signal is transformed by a filter and a non-linearity before being passed to a subsequent layer. The research showed that the key to training deep networks was not the residual connection itself, but the shared characteristic of both ResNets and FractalNets: providing effective paths of varying lengths for gradients to propagate during training.
Instead of additive skip connections, parallel paths in a FractalNet are combined using "join layers," which compute the element-wise mean of their inputs. To prevent the network from simply learning to rely on one path while others atrophy, the authors introduced a novel regularization technique called "drop-path". This method randomly disables subpaths during training in one of two ways:
 * Local Drop-Path: Each input to a join layer is dropped with some probability.
 * Global Drop-Path: An entire, single column (a complete path from input to output of a block) is randomly selected, while all others are dropped.
This process forces every subpath to become a competent predictor on its own and creates an implicit "student-teacher" dynamic, where shallower, faster-learning paths help guide the training of deeper, more complex paths.
A key benefit emerging from this design is the "anytime" property. Since every subpath is a viable, trained network, a fully trained FractalNet can offer a flexible trade-off at inference time. It can provide a quick, though less accurate, prediction by evaluating only a shallow path, or it can take more time to compute a more accurate result by using a deeper path. This is a significant practical advantage for applications with varying latency requirements. The FractalNet concept, inspired by fractal patterns in biological systems , has since been adapted for other tasks, such as time-series forecasting with FractalNet-LSTM.
The juxtaposition of these two theories reveals two fundamentally different philosophies of AI. FractalNet uses "fractal" as a structural metaphor to inform a pre-defined, engineered blueprint, representing a "design" philosophy of intelligence. Fractal AI uses "fractal" to describe the emergent, dynamic evolution of a system's state over time, representing an "emergence" philosophy. Applying both to the CL1 is therefore not merely a technical exercise but a fascinating attempt to hybridize these opposing worldviews.
| Feature | Fractal AI: A Fragile Theory of Intelligence | FractalNet Architectures |
|---|---|---|
| Domain | Decision Theory, Planning, Reinforcement Learning | Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Network Architecture |
| Core Idea | Model state spaces with discrete, CA-like structures; use "forward-thinking" simulation to make optimal decisions. | Build ultra-deep neural networks using recursive, self-similar expansion rules without residual connections. |
| Use of "Fractal" | A metaphor for the emergent, complex, and self-similar dynamics of a system's state evolution over time. | A literal description of the network's static, engineered, self-similar connection topology. |
| Primary Output | A chosen action or a policy (a probability distribution over actions). | A classification, prediction, or generated data (e.g., an image). |
| Key Innovation | Solving exploration/exploitation without prior learning via efficient state-space sampling (FMC). | Training ultra-deep networks without residuals via drop-path regularization; the "anytime" property. |
| Underlying Philosophy | Intelligence as an emergent property of dynamic, "fragile" processes. | Intelligence as a result of hierarchical feature extraction in a well-designed, static architecture. |

Part III: A Speculative Synthesis - Applying Fractal Theories to the CL1
The hypothetical application of these two distinct fractal frameworks to the Cortical Labs CL1 system presents a fascinating thought experiment. It involves layering a designed architecture and a process-based decision theory onto an emergent biological substrate. This synthesis could potentially unlock novel capabilities but also introduces significant conceptual and practical challenges. The analysis proceeds by layering these theories onto the CL1, exploring the potential synergies, conflicts, and emergent properties of the resulting hybrid system.
Section 3.1: FractalNet as a Generative Model for the CL1's Environment
A plausible initial step in this synthesis would be to use a FractalNet architecture not as a replacement for the biological neurons, but as a sophisticated generative model within the biOS. Instead of providing the CL1 with simple, uniform stimuli as in the Pong experiment, a FractalNet could be trained to generate complex, multi-scale, and hierarchically structured sensory data streams. This approach creates a powerful synergy with the CL1's intrinsic learning mechanism.
The Free Energy Principle dictates that the CL1's neurons will spontaneously self-organize to build an internal model that accurately predicts their sensory input, thereby minimizing surprise. If this sensory input is generated by a FractalNet, it will possess inherent self-similar and hierarchical properties. This would, in turn, compel the biological neural network to develop representations that reflect this fractal structure. The CL1 would effectively be learning to perceive and model a world with built-in, multi-scale regularities, which could encourage the formation of more complex and abstract representations within the wetware than simpler stimuli would allow. There is strong evidence that biological neural networks in the brain exhibit fractal or scale-invariant organization, suggesting this is a natural mode of operation. Presenting the CL1 with a fractal environment could therefore be a way to guide its self-organization toward a more brain-like computational structure.
Furthermore, the "anytime" property of FractalNet could be leveraged to create a dynamic and adaptive training environment. The biOS could implement a form of curriculum learning by initially presenting the CL1 with simple, low-detail stimuli generated from a "shallow" path of the FractalNet. As the CL1's internal model adapts, the biOS could progressively increase the environmental complexity by feeding it data from "deeper," more detailed paths of the same network. This would provide a structured way to probe the CL1's capacity for learning and adaptation at increasing levels of abstraction, all while using a single, efficient generative model.
Section 3.2: Fractal AI Theory as a High-Level Control and Interpretation Layer
With the FractalNet providing a rich sensory environment, the Fractal AI framework could be layered on top as a high-level, goal-directed control and interpretation system. This creates a multi-tiered architecture that begins to resemble the hierarchical processing found in vertebrate brains.
In this model, the real-time activity of the CL1's neural population becomes the dynamic "system" that the Fractal AI agent observes and attempts to control. The Fractal AI theory requires a "near-perfect simulation of the system" to conduct its forward-thinking planning ; here, the CL1's FEP-driven response is not a simulation of physics, but a direct, real-time biological computation. The discrete, cellular automaton-like state space central to Fractal AI  could be mapped from the CL1's activity. For instance, the firing patterns across the 800,000 neurons could be captured at discrete time intervals, then binarized or clustered to form the state grid for the Fractal AI model.
The Fractal AI agent would then operate in a loop:
 * Observe: It captures the current state of the CL1's neural activity.
 * Plan: Using its Fractal Monte Carlo (FMC) algorithm, it "scans" the space of potential future neural states that would result from various high-level actions.
 * Decide: It selects the action predicted to lead to the most desirable future state space (e.g., a state associated with high reward or some other desirable property).
 * Act: This chosen action is translated by the biOS into a command, perhaps altering the parameters of the FractalNet environment generator to guide the CL1's learning trajectory toward the desired goal.
This layered architecture provides a compelling, albeit simplified, model of brain hierarchy. The FractalNet acts as a synthetic sensory system, generating complex stimuli. The CL1 acts as a powerful and efficient associative learning substrate, forming representations of this sensory world according to the fundamental imperative to minimize surprise. Finally, the Fractal AI agent functions like a prefrontal cortex, engaging in high-level, goal-directed planning based on the state of the underlying processing system. This hybrid is no longer just an AI; it becomes a powerful in silico and in vitro platform for testing theories of computational neuroscience.
Section 3.3: Potential Conflicts, Challenges, and Emergent Properties
Synthesizing these disparate systems is fraught with challenges and potential conflicts. The most immediate is the conceptual friction between discrete and continuous models. Fractal AI's CA-based framework is fundamentally discrete, while the biological dynamics of the CL1 are continuous, stochastic, and noisy. Any method used to discretize the neural activity for the Fractal AI agent would inevitably lose information, potentially disrupting the model's performance.
This leads to a paradox: applying a "fragile" theory that embraces sensitivity to a system that is inherently noisy is a double-edged sword. The biological noise could overwhelm the delicate dynamics the Fractal AI model relies on. Conversely, the model might be uniquely suited to find stable, emergent patterns within that noise, a task at which more "robust" algorithms might fail. The system's intelligence would then lie not in the stability of any single component, but in the continuous, dynamic process of control and adaptation that keeps the entire fragile assembly operating in a useful regime. This is analogous to a skilled cyclist (the controller) maintaining the stability of a fundamentally unstable system (the bicycle) to move toward a goal. This suggests a new paradigm of achieving robustness through fragility.
Another significant challenge is the amplified black box problem. This hybrid system would be exceptionally opaque, combining a biological black box (the CL1), an architectural black box (the FractalNet), and an algorithmic black box (the Fractal AI planner). Interpreting the system's behavior and debugging failures would be a monumental task.
Finally, the system would be subject to conflicting optimization goals. The CL1's neurons are intrinsically driven to minimize variational free energy (surprise). The Fractal AI agent, however, would be optimizing for an external, human-defined reward function. These two objectives are not necessarily aligned. A state that is highly predictable and low-surprise for the neurons might not be the most valuable for the overarching task. This tension would create a complex, multi-objective optimization landscape, ripe for producing unforeseen emergent behaviors—both functional and dysfunctional.
| Interaction | Potential Synergy (Positive Outcome) | Potential Conflict (Negative Outcome) |
|---|---|---|
| FractalNet (Environment) + CL1 (Substrate) | The CL1 learns to model a complex, hierarchical world, potentially developing more sophisticated internal representations. The "anytime" property allows for curriculum learning. | The complexity of the FractalNet's output might overwhelm the learning capacity of the 2D neuron culture, leading to chaotic, non-functional activity. |
| Fractal AI (Control) + CL1 (Substrate) | The CL1's high sample efficiency and adaptability provide a fast, real-time "simulation" for the Fractal AI planner, creating a powerful, goal-directed learning loop. | The discrete, deterministic model of Fractal AI may be incompatible with the noisy, continuous dynamics of the CL1, leading to model breakdown or information loss. |
| Fractal AI (Theory) + FEP (Learning Rule) | The top-down, goal-directed planning of Fractal AI could provide the "prior preferences" that guide the bottom-up, self-organizing FEP, creating a unified, multi-level intelligence. | The optimization goals may conflict: Fractal AI's reward maximization could push the CL1 into states of high "surprise," directly opposing the FEP's intrinsic drive. |
| Overall System | A novel hybrid intelligence that combines the energy efficiency of biology with the structured control of advanced algorithms, acting as a powerful model for brain function. | An intractable, opaque "black box" whose "fragile" nature makes it unstable and unpredictable, while amplifying ethical concerns about agency and consciousness. |
Section 3.4: Re-evaluating the Ethical Landscape
The creation of such a sophisticated hybrid system would inevitably intensify the existing ethical scrutiny surrounding SBI. The argument that the CL1 is "just a simple 2D culture" would be weakened. A system composed of a hierarchical sensory generator, a biological learning core, and a goal-directed planning agent could be argued to possess a more structured and potent form of cognition.
This would make the questions of moral status and potential sentience more pressing and less speculative. Furthermore, it would blur the lines of agency and responsibility. If such a system were to cause harm, who would be accountable? The human who designed the Fractal AI's reward function? The emergent properties of the interaction between the layers? Or the self-organizing biological core itself? Finally, the "fragility" of the system introduces a new ethical dilemma. Deploying a powerful but potentially unstable form of intelligence would require careful consideration of its failure modes and the potential for unpredictable, catastrophic behavior.
Part IV: Conclusion and Future Directions
Section 4.1: Summary of the Hypothetical System
This analysis has explored a hypothetical synthesis of three distinct technologies: the Cortical Labs CL1 biological computer, the FractalNet architecture, and the Fractal AI decision theory. The resulting conceptual system is a three-tiered architecture:
 * Sensory Layer: A FractalNet generates a rich, controllable sensory environment with inherent multi-scale structure.
 * Processing Layer: The CL1, as a biological processing core driven by the Free Energy Principle, serves as a highly efficient and adaptive substrate that learns to model this fractal environment.
 * Control Layer: The Fractal AI theory provides a high-level planning agent that observes the CL1's state and uses forward-thinking simulation to guide its behavior toward long-term, human-defined goals.
This speculative synthesis represents a potential pathway from the simple Synthetic Biological Intelligence demonstrated by the CL1 toward a more structured, functional, and powerful form of biocomputing. It achieves this by leveraging the respective strengths of designed silicon architectures, emergent biological learning, and advanced process-based AI theories.
Section 4.2: A New Frontier for Biologically-Inspired AI
This thought experiment points toward a future for artificial intelligence that moves beyond being merely inspired by biology to creating a true symbiosis between biological and silicon computation. The proposed hybrid model, while far from Artificial General Intelligence, directly addresses several key challenges in the field, including the critical needs for greater energy efficiency, sample efficiency, and the capacity for continuous, adaptive learning. The fusion of a bottom-up, self-organizing principle like the FEP with a top-down, goal-directed planning framework like Fractal AI represents a promising avenue for developing more general and capable forms of intelligence.
Ultimately, this exploration suggests a profound shift in what it might mean to "program" the intelligent systems of the future. The task may evolve from writing explicit, imperative code to a more holistic and indirect practice. The future programmer of such a system may act less like a software engineer and more like an architect of virtual worlds, a designer of reward landscapes, and a curator of informational environments. In this paradigm, intelligence is not explicitly built but is guided to emerge and learn within the sophisticated boundaries that are created for it. This elevates the role of the human developer to that of a systems-level neuro-ethologist for a new and unprecedented kind of digital and biological life.
